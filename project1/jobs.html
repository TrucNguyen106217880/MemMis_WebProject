		<h2 class="smol_h">About the role:</h2>
		<p class="desc">As a Cybersecurity Specialist, you are responsible for protecting the organization’s digital infrastructure, systems, and sensitive data from cyber threats. Your role involves designing and implementing security protocols, monitoring systems for vulnerabilities, and responding swiftly to incidents to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets.
You will collaborate with IT teams, developers, and business units to assess risks, enforce security policies, and integrate cybersecurity best practices into network and software architecture. Key responsibilities include conducting regular security audits, penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and managing tools such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint protection platforms.
A strong understanding of cybersecurity frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001), encryption standards, and regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) is essential. You should be proficient in using SIEM tools, scripting languages like Python or PowerShell, and cloud security platforms such as AWS or Azure.
Beyond technical expertise, you must demonstrate strong analytical thinking, attention to detail, and the ability to communicate security risks and solutions to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. You will also contribute to employee training and awareness programs to foster a security-conscious culture.
Your work is vital to maintaining operational continuity, protecting customer trust, and defending against evolving cyber threats in a dynamic digital landscape.
